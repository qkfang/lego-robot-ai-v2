  "doc_text": "### Next Steps\n\nIn the previous chapters, you\n\n*   learned the basics of using Python with SPIKE Prime, and how to use the Hub Light Matrix, Light, Speaker, and Buttons, as well as the motors, Color Sensor, and Force Sensor.\n*   became familiar with regular and asynchronous functions, local and global variables, and data types such as `int`, `bool`, `str`, `tuple`, and `list`.\n*   used `for` and `while` loops, as well as `if`/`elif`/`else` statements to control the flow of your program.\n*   learned how to use comments in your code, and when things go wrong, how to debug the program.\n\nThis is quite an achievement – you can be proud of yourself!\n\nThere are additional resources you can access to learn even more about using Python with SPIKE Prime.\n\n#### Python User Guide\n\nThis **Getting Started** section has barely scratched the surface of what’s possible with Python and SPIKE Prime. Explore these two other sections of the Python User Guide.\n\n1.  **Examples** Find example programs that show how to use Python to solve various tasks. Copy and try them, then modify them to suit your needs.\n2.  **SPIKE Prime Modules** Find documentation of all the functions and variables in the SPIKE Prime modules with short examples of how to use them.\n\n#### Python Lessons\n\nOn the LEGOeducation.com/lessons website, select the product **SPIKE™ Prime with Python**. You’ll find several unit plans with 6–8 lessons each (available in English only). These 50+ lessons cover a wide range of topics, from debugging to sensor control, and from simple games to data and math functions. Discover the many possibilities and become an expert using Python with SPIKE Prime.\n\n#### Challenge\n\nCreate a new Python project and get coding!"
